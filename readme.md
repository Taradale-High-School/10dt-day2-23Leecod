# Taking user input
## Input
Let's take a look at the input command and how that works. Input is when the user gives information to the computer.

It's very similar to the print command, except that it'll show the message in the console then wait until the user has typed something into the console and pressed enter. Let's try it!

# Variables
## What is a variable?
input asks for something, takes it, but then has nowhere to put it. We can change that with a variable which is a value that we can use to name and store data. (Remember, David's box for David's phone?)

## Naming variables
You can give a variable any name you want, but you can't use spaces. You can use:
 - underscores_between_words
 - camelCaseToMakeItEasierToRead

## Printing a Variable
You can print your variable using print and the name you used for your variable in your input command. Remember the three variables we just created: myName, myAge and replit?

In your code you can now print 'name' by using print(myName) or 'age' by using print(myAge).
